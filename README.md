# Home Directory Files

This repository contains several files from my home directory to enable syncing
quickly across devices and customizing new machines with my preferred settings.
Hidden files and directories in the home directory have the `.` removed here.
The script `install.sh` copies all files to the home directory and creates
hard links so that changes will be reflected here.
